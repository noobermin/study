study
=====

This is a repository of notes I have for various mathematical and physical texts I've read.

What
----

Primarily, this contains derivations and comments on a number of books I've read. Hopefully, this will help people check and make sure they understand the "steps between eqn. (141) and (145)" when they are omitted. I primarily use TeXmacs, a LaTeX-like language for the super cool (albeit somewhat glitchy and underdeveloped WYSIWYG editor, TeXmacs). I will/may export to LaTeX or pdf as much as I can or am willing to.

Who
---

I am a graduate student in theoretical physics (currently studying laser-plasma interactions in high energy density systems) at a large university somewhere.

License

See LICENSE. It is essentially a variant of the MIT license.

(why a warranty clause?)
------------------------
I don't want to be sued because someone failed their quals because they followed my notes. I want them to be as correct as they can be, but I am busy person after all, and worse, a busy person in graduate school.
